1D-RHD Module Repository
========================

Computes 1D-RHD solutions on fixed grids. New solvers can be implemented easily to compare with other codes.

Missing features:
-----------------
- No boundary treatment so far.
- Cylindrical and spherical geometry
- Higher order spatial reconstruction
